# SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction
Summary

Used SpaceX API data, performed EDA with SQL, created interactive tools, and applied classification models (SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression) to predict rocket landing success with 83.3% accuracy.

Solution

The solution achieved the project objectives by accurately predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landings using classification models. The data was collected, cleaned, and analyzed to develop predictive models that provided actionable insights, such as the relationship between payload weight and mission success, as well as the most successful launch sites. This directly supports SpaceXâ€™s goal of reducing costs through the reuse of rocket stages.

Approach

Collected SpaceX data via API/web scraping, cleaned it, performed EDA with SQL/visuals, built interactive tools with Folium/Plotly, and developed/evaluated predictive models to determine rocket landing success.
